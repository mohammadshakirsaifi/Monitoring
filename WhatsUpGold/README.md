#### Discover, Map and Monitor Your Network Devices in Minutes with the Network Discovery Tool by WhatsUp Gold
- **Discover everything connected to your network from devices, servers, deployed software, Windows, wireless and virtual infrastructures and more. The WhatsUp Gold's Network Discovery Tool features powerful Layer 2/3 discovery which can be initiated from an IP Range Scan or SNMP Smart Scan of a core router’s Bridge Table to generate a detailed map of your network from top to bottom - so you can focus on keeping it running securely and at peak performance.**
  - Map, inventory, and visualize your network topology and interdependencies
  - Document and track all your IT assets with enhanced inventory discovery
  - Troubleshoot connectivity issues with Layer 2 Trace and IP/ Mac Finder tools
  
### Discover Devices On Your Network
- **The WhatsUp Gold's Network Discovery Software uses a number of innovative Layer 2/3 discovery technologies - including ARP, SNMP, SSH, Virtual Infrastructure Management, IP addressing, ICMP and LLDP in combination with vendor-proprietary mechanisms - to discover everything connected to your network and build a complete and accurate picture of network devices and their port-to-port connectivity.. Full or partial discoveries can be scheduled to run automatically or run on-demand.**

### Visualize with Network Maps
- **The WhatsUp Gold Network Discovery Tool auto-generates integrated Layer 2 and 3 network maps that give you full visibility into physical, logical, and virtual connectivity, including IP and VLAN-specific information. It dynamically updates its maps as changes occur in the network. Maps are easy to customize and manipulate so you can view your network the way you want.**

### Assign Device Roles and Dependencies
- **At the completion of the discovery process, WhatsUp Gold automatically assigns devices roles that specify what data to collect and remedial actions that are enabled. You can easily modify default device roles and sub-roles or create new ones with the Device Role Editor. The automated network discovery process also identifies dependencies that are marked on the map as directional arrows. With a couple of mouse clicks, dependency data can be used to suppress unnecessary alerts saving valuable troubleshooting time by minimizing false alerts.**

###  Maintain an Accurate Network Inventory
- **WhatsUp Gold provides comprehensive network inventory and configuration information – supporting the reporting/ documentation needs of your internal business process (such as ITIL) and regulatory requirements like PCI DSS, SOX, FISMA and HIPAA. Since you can easily export this information in CSV or Excel formats, your entire team will know exactly what resources are on your network, where they are and how they are connected at all times – even when your network grows, your office moves or datacenter resources get consolidated.**

### Manage Your Network Assets
- Gather, filter and export a wide variety of inventory and configuration information across networking devices and systems.
  - Networking Devices Asset Information: Manufacturer/Model, Serial Number, Hardware/Software/ Firmware Versions, Chassis/Module Inventory, Power Supplies/Fans
  - Configuration Information: Interfaces, Bridge Ports, Switch Ports, VLANs
  - Systems Inventory: All available system component details (CPU, RAM, disks, etc.), OS version & patch information, any installed software packages, support for automatic update of warranty information (Dell and HP) based on integration with their support websites
